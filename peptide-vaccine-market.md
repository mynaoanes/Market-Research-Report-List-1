<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peptide Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solution Phase Synthesis (SPS)</li><li>Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The peptide vaccine market encompasses two primary synthesis methods: Solution Phase Synthesis (SPS) and Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS). SPS involves synthesizing peptides in a liquid environment, allowing for greater flexibility and longer peptide chains but often with lower purity. Conversely, SPPS is a more widely used technique where peptides are sequentially built on a solid support, yielding higher purity and more efficient synthesis of shorter peptides. Both methods play crucial roles in developing effective peptide-based vaccines.</p></p>
